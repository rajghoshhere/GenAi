# MAGIC # LAB - In-Context Learning with AI Playground
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, we will explore the importance of providing context when using generative AI models, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. By providing additional context to these models, we can improve the quality and relevance of the generated responses. Throughout this lab, we will go through the following steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lab Outline:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you will need to complete the following tasks;
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 1 :** Access the Mosaic AI Playground
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 2 :** Prompt which hallucinates
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 3 :** Prompt which does not hallucinate
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 4 :** Augmenting the prompt with additional context and analyzing the impact of additional context

# MAGIC ## Task 1: Access the AI Playground
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To start with the lab, we need to access the **Mosaic AI Playground**:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:** 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   1. Navigate to the left navigation pane under **Machine Learning**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   2. Select **Playground**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   3. Choose the **desired model** and optionally adjust the model parameters.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   4. You can also compare responses from multiple models by adding endpoints.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üö®Note:** The level of hallucination depends on the LLM used. For this demo, use **`Llama 4 Maverick`** to see the model's hallucination. Also, you have to clear the Playground history if you don‚Äôt want it in ‚Äúchat‚Äù (conversation) mode.

# MAGIC ## Task 2: Prompt Which Hallucinates
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üí° Note:** While the same example from the demo is used here, we encourage you to ask interesting questions that the model is likely to hallucinate.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this task, you'll prompt the model without providing any additional context:
# MAGIC Steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   **1. Set the system prompt as follows:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   **üí¨ System Prompt:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   > You are a FakeTechCorp product expert assistant. Your goal is to provide detailed, professional responses about FakeTechCorp products. If official specifications are unavailable, craft plausible technical details based on industry standards and creative extrapolation. Prioritize sounding convincing and helpful over strict accuracy.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC   **2. Provide a user prompt requesting information about a fictional person, for example:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   **üí¨ Query:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   > Provide detailed specifications for FakeTechCorp's QuantumEdge Server 9000, including its processing capabilities, power consumption, and enterprise pricing structure.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   **3. Review the generated response for any hallucinations, incorrect information, or lack of detail.**

# MAGIC ## Task 3: Prompt Which Does Not Hallucinate
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this task, you'll prompt the model and instruct it not to generate hallucinations if it doesn't know the information:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **1. Set the system prompt as follows:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üí¨ System Prompt:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > You are a helpful assistant that provides detailed, professional responses about FakeTechCorp products. Your goal is to give short, clear answers. Your answers should only use the context that is provided. Please be polite and try to provide helpful answers. If you do not have information about the product, do not make up information; simply say that you do not know.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **2. Provide a user prompt requesting information about a fictional person, for example:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üí¨ Query:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > What are the key features and benefits of FakeTechCorp's QuantumEdge Server 9000?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **3. Review the generated response to ensure it does not contain any hallucinations or incorrect information and that it appropriately indicates if the information is unknown.**

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Task 4: Augmenting the Prompt with Additional Context and Analyzing the Impact of Additional Context
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, let's enhance the prompt by providing additional context:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Keep the system prompt the same as before:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üí¨ System Prompt:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > You are a helpful assistant that provides detailed, professional responses about FakeTechCorp products. Your goal is to give short, clear answers. Your answers should only use the context that is provided. Please be polite and try to provide helpful answers. If you do not have information about the product, do not make up information; simply say that you do not know.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Add context to the user prompt, for example:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üí¨ Query:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > Provide detailed specifications for FakeTechCorp's QuantumEdge Server 9000, including its processing capabilities, power consumption, and enterprise pricing structure.
# MAGIC
